# How Zoqq Payouts Work

Zoqq Payouts enables businesses to make faster, more cost-effective payouts across the globe by connecting to local clearing systems in over 110 countries. With a single Zoqq account and/or one integration, you (and your customers) will be able to move funds globally via Zoqq's payout network, which currently supports local and SWIFT payouts in 170 countries/regions and over 60 currencies.

> Find out more about our [Payout network].

## Use Cases

Zoqq Payouts APIs allow you to create multiple transfers programmatically in seconds for different types of use cases:

- Making payouts for your own business purposes.
- Building a product experience that helps your customers make payouts.

You have full control over how you want to integrate with your internal systems (first-party use case) or customer-facing products (third-party use case) and when you want to release payouts.

To save development effort, you can also use our **Embedded Payout component** and **Embedded Beneficiary component** to collect and manage payout/beneficiary information with minimal coding.
